## Using Python Dependency Manager (PDM)

It's already hard enough to manage python packages. Install and use [Python Dependency Manager (PDM)](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/)

To get started run the following commands:

Activate a virtual environment

```sh
pdm venv activate
```

Install packages

```sh
pdm install
```

Run the consumer to process data

```sh
pdm start
```
